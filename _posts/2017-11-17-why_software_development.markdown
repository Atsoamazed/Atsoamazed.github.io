My coding journey started back in January 2017. I graduated with a non-tech degree, but was very interested in seeing if programming would be for me. I did a ton of research and found free online resources such as Coursea, Khan academy, Code academy, code school, and Free Code Camp. I read so many programming books to help with my coding journey. 

I spent the last 5 years working in technical support. I really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. I always felt like I could do more and be more. I was looking for a challenge. I worked my way through HTML and CSS. Then started working through Learn free bootcamp prep. I was hooked at how challenged I felt and how accomplished I felt after solving each lab and project. I was making stuff work!! Enrolling in this full stack bootcamp I hope to gain the skills I need to become a software engineer.
